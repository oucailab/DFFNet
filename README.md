Dynamic Frequency Feature Fusion Network (DFFNet) is designed for hyperspectral image and SAR/LiDAR data joint classification. Specifically, we design a dynamic filter block to dynamically learn the filter kernels in the frequency domain by aggregating the input features. The frequency contextual knowledge is injected into frequency filter kernels. Additionally, we propose spectral-spatial adaptive fusion block for cross-modal feature fusion. It enhances the spectral and spatial attention weight interactions via channel shuffle operation, thereby providing comprehensive cross-modal feature fusion.
